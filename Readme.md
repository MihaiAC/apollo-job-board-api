# apollo-job-board-api

A practice GraphQL API using Apollo, Express, and Prisma.

Aim of the project is to get some experience with a Node.js stack by recreating my previous GraphQL [project](https://github.com/MihaiAC/strawberry-job-board-api), which used Strawberry, FastAPI, and SQLAlchemy.

Here, I will only talk about the differences between these two projects and will focus less on testing.
